### Day 1: July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started new project for learning ReactJS.

**Thoughts**: Setting up webpack and project structure manually is really a struggle! Maybe that's why they created js scripts to automatically setup. But I guess I should get an understanding of how things work for a start.

### Day 2: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished first project with ReactJS

**Thoughts**: Need to learn more about states and props in React. Although the concepts seem fairly easy. I tend to take up a lot of time in styling the apps. Need to learn CSS and be better at it.

### Day 3: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Trying to get as much done with vanilla JavaScript as possible. Data Structures and Algorithms using JS.

**Thoughts**: Realized that frameworks and libraries make life easy, but a good knowledge of basic JavaScript is very essential to develop softwares and getting things done.
