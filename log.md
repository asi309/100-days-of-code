### Day 1: July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started new project for learning ReactJS.

**Thoughts**: Setting up webpack and project structure manually is really a struggle! Maybe that's why they created js scripts to automatically setup. But I guess I should get an understanding of how things work for a start.

### Day 2: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished first project with ReactJS

**Thoughts**: Need to learn more about states and props in React. Although the concepts seem fairly easy. I tend to take up a lot of time in styling the apps. Need to learn CSS and be better at it.

### Day 3: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Trying to get as much done with vanilla JavaScript as possible. Data Structures and Algorithms using JS.

**Thoughts**: Realized that frameworks and libraries make life easy, but a good knowledge of basic JavaScript is very essential to develop softwares and getting things done.

### Day 5: August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A fun day with vanilla JS. Started 2 new projects for both JS and ReactJS

**Thoughts**: I am enjoying this process of learning by doing. Still have a lot to learn, especially in setting up environment for ReactJS. (or) maybe start using libraries like start-react-app and nextjs

### Day 7: August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A lot of work on the blogger app I have been creating over the last few days, learning Routers in ReactJS. Also learning about prototype objects and prototype attributes in vanilla JS.

**Thoughts**: The more I learn, the less it seems every day. Keeping this repo updated is proving a challenge as of now. ;-)
