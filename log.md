### Day 1: July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started new project for learning ReactJS.

**Thoughts**: Setting up webpack and project structure manually is really a struggle! Maybe that's why they created js scripts to automatically setup. But I guess I should get an understanding of how things work for a start.
